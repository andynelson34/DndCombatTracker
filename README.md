I made this app to teach myself some React, but also because I run a D&D game with friends and it was a pain to keep track of big combat encounters on paper.

This simple tracker allows you to add creatures to the combat list and track their hp; it automatically sorts them into initiative order as they’re added or as their initiative changes, even mid-combat. You can use the “advance turn” button to track whose turn it is - the active creature will be highlighted. You can also delete creatures from the encounter as they die/flee/get plane-shifted to the Nine Hells. The tracker at the bottom allows you to see the total length of the encounter in rounds and minutes/seconds.

It’s readable but plain right now, so I’ll do something more interesting with the styling at some point. Other future improvements might include pre-entering, saving, and easy adding of groups of monsters and NPCs, so you don’t have to manually type in their data at the start of the encounter as your players are telling you their characters’ inits, and also tracking of statuses like poison/stunning/etc.
